# PokeVerse

This is a game made in **GameMaker Studio**, inspired by famous games like *Pokemon* and *Street Fighter*.

This game uses *custom* sprites made by the original creator **JoshR691**.  

Creatures from the Pokémon world want to battle each other, but this time, they take a little *Hands on* approach.
